1. How to combine dimensions and physical quantities.

Right now, a physical quantity has different units,
with values relative to a basic unit. It has no concept
of dimension.

If I have, for example 
d = Distance("20m")
t = Time("10s")
s = d/t should be the same as s = Speed("2 m/s")
but the div operator doesn't know about the set of units I've defined for Speed.

Q: Should I make it all consistent? I.e., only define a set of units for primitive
dimensions and have the other dimensions have primitive units that are derived
from the others.

For example, if
Distance {'m': 1, 'km': 1000}
Time {'s': 1, 'min': 60}
then if Speed = Distance/Time, then automatically we'll have
Speed {'m/s': 1, 'm/min': 1/60, 'km/s': 1000, 'km/min': 1000/60 }

But I want to avoid a large number of units in derivative quantities.
For example, what would be the set of units available to Speed/Time?
I would like for this to have only "unmixed" units:
m/s^2, m/min^2, km/s^2, km/min^2
and NOT m/s/min, km/s/min.

For this I need to distinguish between basic quantities and derived quantities.
The set of units in derived quantities will always be defined from the set
of units in primitive quantities.
